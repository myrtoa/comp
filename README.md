comp challenge

***************************
IDEA for implementation
***************************
For this challenge the p5.js library was used, a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing. More on https://p5js.org/ .
My idea was to introduce the use of this library to a broader range of websites rather than use it only in "creative websites", so that there are more ways of interaction for the user experience (mouse events, camera events and more), and many more options while designing interfaces.
Ideally you could have interfaces designed with a lot more freedom of expression and imagination that could improve the user experience.
